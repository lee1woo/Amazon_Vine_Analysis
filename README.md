- What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
34.12 % of Vine reviews were 5 stars.
48.34 % of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars.


## Summary: 

There is a slight bias within this dataset. Vine reviews were less likely to be 5 stars, suggesting that those who pay for the service are more judicious and stringent in their standrads. As you cee above, 34.12% of Vine reviews were 5 stars while nearly 50% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars. 

Since this is a dataset that is looking at specific types of reviews, to have a more comprehensive study and to be able to better determine whether there is a bias, there would need to be further analysis on more categories of reviews. It could be that different types of products attract different types of customers that has no relation to paying customers for Vine. As such, we would have to do more studies across different categories.
